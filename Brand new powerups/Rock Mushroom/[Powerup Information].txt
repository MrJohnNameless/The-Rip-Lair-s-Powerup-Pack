This powerup has some configs you can apply. Simple open the file "rockMushroom.lua", using something like notepad++ or visual studio code.

setSpeed - If true, the player will accelerate towards a set speed and gradually slow down to reach that speed again when faster
rollSpeed - The speed the player is rolling at by default
rollAccel - How quickly the rock accelerates
rollDeccel - How quickly the rock deccelerates if it's faster than rollSpeed
rollAnimDelay - Amount of frames between each animation frame (of the startup)
rockWidth - Width of the player hitbox when in a rock
rockHeight - Height of the player hitbox when in a rock
cooldown - How many frames the player has to wait until they can start rollin' again
canCancel - If 0, you can't cancel anything. If 1, you can cancel the startup animation by holding down. If 2, you can cancel the rolling as well
isInvulnerable - If true, the player will not take damage in rock formation but just leave it and get a few I-frames
