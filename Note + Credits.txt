This is a massive collaboration project by many members of "The Rip Lair", a discord server that primarily works on the Online GFX Pack.

Please credit accordingly! As everyone made something different, it's important to do so.

You can check each folder to see who made what powerup.

These all use Marioman2007's powerup script called "customPowerups.lua".
Big thanks to him!

Thanks to Emral as well, for without his original powerup script this would not have been possible!

Thanks to DisasterMaster for converting and organising so many of the powerups in this pack from older packs!

Also, a special thanks to Sleepy Dee, as he made most of the sprites to the player spritesheets. So please check the folders to see who sprited what.
